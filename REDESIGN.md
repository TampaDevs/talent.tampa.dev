# Redesign

Notes as [the redesign](https://github.com/tampadevs/talent.tampa.dev/milestone/5) gets implemented.

## Assumptions made

* There was no active styling given for the mobile menu items. I've opted for them to not be full width so that they match the desktop styles

## Fixes needed

* Medium-sized buttons use 12px of padding instead of 16px
* I've increased the spacing between mobile menu items so that the active state is more clear
