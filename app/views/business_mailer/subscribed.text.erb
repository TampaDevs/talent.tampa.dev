Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

It's the Tampa Devs Talent team here with a couple of updates. Your subscription is live and you can message all <%= @developer_count %>+ developers on the platform.

Get started by adding a filter or two when browsing developer profiles. Start with role level and work preference then try adding a specific term or technology:  <%= developers_url %>

When you see a good fit click the Hire button. Your message goes right to their email inbox.

Hit reply or reach out to us at jobs@tampadevs.com if youâ€™d like help narrowing down your search!

And thank you for supporting Tampa Devs, the fastest-growing nonprofit software development community in Tampa Bay.
