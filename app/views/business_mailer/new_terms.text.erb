Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

It's the team at <%= link_to "Tampa Devs Talent", root_url %>, with two quick updates. You’re receiving this email because you have an active or past subscription.

1. The terms of use have been updated: <%= policies_terms_url %>
2. There is now an official hiring agreement: <%= hiring_agreement_terms_url %>

The hiring agreement formalizes the existing 5% fee that customers pay for hiring full-time employees. The amount, collection, and requirements have all remained the same.

If you don’t agree with these terms, please let us know within 7 days and we'll cancel your subscription. If you have any questions, you can reply directly to this email.
