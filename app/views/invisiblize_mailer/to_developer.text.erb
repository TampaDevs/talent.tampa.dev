Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,

Tampa Devs Talent team here. Your developer profile (<%= notification_url(@notification.record) %>) was flagged because it doesn't contain enough information and triggered our spam filters.

I've set your profile to invisible – only you can see it. You can toggle this back to visible after you add more details to your profile.
