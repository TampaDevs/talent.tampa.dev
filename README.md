## Original inspiration

This project is based on the incredible work of [Joe Masilloti](https://github.com/joemasilotti/) on [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com).

## Getting started

### Requirements

You will need a few non-Ruby packages installed. Install these at once via:

```bash
brew bundle install --no-upgrade
```

...or manually:

* Ruby 3.1.2
* [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/libpq.html) - `brew install libpq`
    * `libpg` is needed to use the native `pg` gem without Rosetta on M1 macs
* [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org) - `brew install postgresql`
    * Note 1: PostgreSQL 13+ is required
    * Note 2: In case you're on Debian 11 and you have multiple versions (e.g. 9.x, 12.x, 14.x) of PostgreSQL installed, make sure that the server of the right version (13+) is listening on port `5432`. One could check/modify that in the `postgresql.conf` file, e.g. in case of version 13: `/etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf`.
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - `brew install node`
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - `brew install yarn`
* [Redis](https://redis.io) - `brew install redis`
* [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) - `brew install imagemagick`
* [libvips](https://www.libvips.org) - `brew install vips`
* [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) - `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`
* [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) - `gem install foreman`
* Google Chrome + Chromedriver for system tests - `brew install --cask google-chrome chromedriver`

### Initial setup

Start the PostgreSQL server.

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

Start the Redis server.

```bash
brew services start redis
```

An installation script is included with the repository that will automatically get the application set up.

```bash
bin/setup
```

## Development

Run the following to start the server and automatically build assets.

* Requires `foreman` or `overmind`
* Requires `stripe`

```bash
bin/dev
```

### Seeds

Seeding the database, either via `rails db:seed` or during `bin/setup`, creates a few accounts. Most importantly, use `developer@example.com` and `business@example.com` with password `password`.

More information is in [the docs on seeds](docs/seeds.md).

### Stripe

You will need to configure Stripe or do a mock configuration (ie set dummy values for the last step listed below) if you are working on anything related to payments.

1. [Register for Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) and add an account
1. Download the Stripe CLI via `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`
1. Login to the Stripe CLI via `stripe login`
1. Configure your development credentials
    1. [Create a Stripe secret key for test mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
    1. Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/pay/webhooks/stripe` in order to generate your webhook signing secret.
    1. [Create a product](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/create) with a recurring, monthly price
    1. Generate your editable development credentials file via `EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit --environment development`. You may need to install and provide terminal access to the editor first (mate, subl, and atom should all work). If you run the code above and receive the message "New credentials encrypted and saved", without having had the opportunity to edit the file first, things have gone astray. You will need to troubleshoot this step based on your OS and desired editor, to ensure you can edit the development.yml file before it is encoded and saved. [See here for more details.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52370065/issue-to-open-credentials-file)
    1. Add the secret key, the price, and your webhook signing secret to your development credentials in the following format, and save/close the file:

```
stripe:
  private_key: sk_test_YOUR_TEST_STRIPE_KEY
  signing_secret: whsec_YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET
  price_ids:
    part_time: price_YOUR_PRODUCT_PRICE_ID
    full_time: price_ANOTHER_PRODUCT_PRICE_ID
```

## Monitoring

Application monitoring is powered by [Scout APM](https://scoutapm.com). This helps identify N+1 queries, slow queries, memory bloats, and more. Scout APM is free for open source.

## Testing

* Run `rails test` to run unit/integration tests.
* Run `rails test:system` to run system tests, using `headless_chrome`.
* Run `HEADFUL=1 rails test:system` to run system tests, using `headful_chrome`.

## Changelog

Significant changes and product updates are documented in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
